# twtfake
Trick Twitter into showing a fake link.

NOTE: This is a known issue and I just wanted to hop onto the bandwagon before Twitter (hopefully) patches it. I did not invent this.

Usage:
`https://twtfake.bestadamdagoat.com/?fakelink=https://example.com/fake&reallink=https://example.com/real`

shows `example.com/fake` on twitter

shows `example.com/real` after clicking
